sprint breakout with fadecandy discussion


get shield with fadecandy to lauren

determine the number of shields
- 2 for us (cody and ben/lauren)
- 6 Vitra robots
- rework others for after

pros/cons of rework
- do fadecandy need to be soldered
- removal of caps
- line driver buffer

shield swap installation time

--------

shields with attached fadecandy boards
- lots of them in various places around the office
- Some have the 8/22 rework (remove all caps)
- some only have the 6/29 rework (install headers, fadecandy, headlight driver)
- The only thing we need to do would be to add 2 caps back to the 2 channels we are using OR remove 2 caps from the 2 channels we aren't using. Easy through hole.

There are plenty of USB cables

UI Panel cable rework
- swap all pins (GND, PWR, TX, RX) on one end.

Assembly
- need to get some pins for the Mikrobus header. Some of the shields have them attached.
- rear rangers assembly instructions need to specify which jack to use.

line driver rework (hardest one)
- attach the Schmitt trigger buffer to the TX UART line going to the UI panel.
- need to cut a trace and glue the component down.
- the fadecandy is kinda in the way. this is the biggest hassle.
