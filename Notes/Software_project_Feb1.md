Software Project meeting notes
2/1/2018

Make sure that we are sticking to the use cases. No feature creep

UI controller
- keep messaging infrastructure consistent
	- use cases at each build stage (aplha, beta)
	- need to check performance
	- abstraction layers

Interfaces
- need to kep QA in mind
- unit tests

Phone is the support interface not the primary

GPS integration

show functional layers instead of screenshots for Italian's meeting
	- don't make layers too deep

Watchdogs everywhere

What are the different modules?
- UI vs External comms
- make it part of host?

Audio quality should be considered sooner	

Monitoring and diagnostics

GOC?

level of interface (who's using the robot/software)
