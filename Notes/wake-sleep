functional flow discussion for waking and sleeping the robot (3/22)

needs to Park before Sleep

sleep timers
battery
external input

boot time < 10sec
full boot different than showing lights and UX

blinking light while in sleep mode - which ones?

UI panel message is asynchronous
no realtime constraints

power management states

ability to turn peripherals off on IO

OFF = no power
SLEEP = low power

microcontroller to do power sequencing - power initiation instead of a master toggle switch
	use soft switch

what is the UI feedback for low power mode
